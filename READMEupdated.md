# Description

This application is a single page site built with React and Bootstrap. It consists of multiple pages to swap between with a Home page, About Me, Portfolio, and a working
Contact page. These pages render based on what nav bar the user clicks on. The contact page works through a package called EmailJS, with its respective site to send email
as a third party.
